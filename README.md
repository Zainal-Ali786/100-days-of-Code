# 100-days-of-Code-Coffee_Machine
In this project we were tasked with creating a virtual coffee machine.
The user is prompted for inputs on what drink they want, and how many of each coin they are inserting.

The machine will then check to see if there are enough resources (Coffee, Milk, Water) to produce the drink, and also check that the user inserted enogh funds.

The machine will dispense the drink and return any change.

By typing "report" at the initial prompt, a report of the resources and money contained in the machine is returned.
